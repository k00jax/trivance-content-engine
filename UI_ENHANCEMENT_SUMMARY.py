UI Enhancement Test and Summary
==============================

This file summarizes the changes made to improve the article selection interface:

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
===================

1. REMOVED: "Next Article" button
2. ADDED: Top 3 articles per RSS feed source displayed as clickable list
3. ADDED: "Choose Most Relevant Article" button for auto-selection
4. ENHANCED: Article display with source grouping and relevance scores

KEY FEATURES:
============

1. Article Grouping by Source:
   - Articles are grouped by their RSS feed source
   - Up to 3 highest-scoring articles shown per source
   - Clean visual organization

2. Clickable Article Selection:
   - Each article title is a clickable button
   - Shows relevance score next to title
   - Selected article is highlighted with primary button style
   - Truncates long titles to 60 characters for clean display

3. Smart Auto-Selection:
   - "Choose Most Relevant Article" button selects highest scoring article
   - Initial fetch auto-selects the top article
   - Maintains existing article scoring and ranking

4. Enhanced Data Source:
   - Uses `/feeds/articles/all` endpoint with `limit_per_feed=3`
   - Gets articles with source_feed information for proper grouping
   - Maintains all existing metadata (score, published date, link, etc.)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
========================

Modified Files:
- ui/streamlit_app.py (lines ~89-130): Replaced "Next Article" logic with article list
- ui/streamlit_app.py (lines ~75-88): Updated fetch logic to use articles/all endpoint

Code Structure:
- Groups articles by source_feed field
- Sorts each group by relevance score (descending)
- Creates unique button keys to prevent Streamlit conflicts
- Maintains session state for selected article
- Provides visual feedback for currently selected article

UI Flow:
1. User clicks "FETCH ARTICLE"
2. System fetches top 3 articles from each RSS feed
3. Articles displayed in grouped list with scores
4. User can click any article title to select it
5. User can click "Choose Most Relevant" for auto-selection
6. Selected article appears in the right panel for generation

TESTING:
========

To test these changes:

1. Start the FastAPI backend:
   cd "c:\\Users\\black\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Trivance AI\\trivance-content-engine"
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

2. Start the Streamlit frontend:
   streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py

3. Go to the "Generate Post" tab
4. Click "FETCH ARTICLE" 
5. Verify you see articles grouped by source with clickable titles
6. Test clicking different articles to select them
7. Test the "Choose Most Relevant Article" button

Expected Behavior:
- No "Next Article" button should be visible
- Articles should be grouped by RSS feed source name
- Clicking article titles should select them
- Selected article should be highlighted
- Most relevant button should select highest scoring article
- Article details should appear in right panel when selected

BENEFITS:
=========

1. Better User Experience:
   - See all available articles at once
   - Easy comparison between sources
   - Clear relevance scoring
   - Direct selection vs cycling through

2. Improved Workflow:
   - Faster article selection
   - Better source visibility  
   - Smart auto-selection option
   - Maintains existing generation workflow

3. Technical Improvements:
   - Uses existing API efficiently
   - Maintains all existing functionality
   - Clean code organization
   - Proper error handling

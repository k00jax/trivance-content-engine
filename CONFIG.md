# Trivance AI Content Engine Configuration

## Environment Variables

### OpenAI GPT Integration (✅ CONFIGURED)

OpenAI GPT-powered content generation is now **ENABLED**:

1. **✅ OpenAI library installed:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

2. **✅ Environment variables configured in `.env` file:**
   ```
   USE_OPENAI_GPT=true
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **✅ Dependencies added to requirements.txt:**
   - `python-dotenv` for environment variable loading
   - `openai>=1.0.0` for GPT integration

### Fallback Behavior

If GPT is not configured or fails:
- The app automatically falls back to template-based generation
- Templates use the same Trivance AI voice and structure
- Multiple template variations provide content variety
- No functionality is lost

### Content Generation Methods

**Template-Based (Default):**
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Consistent Trivance voice
- ✅ Fast generation
- ✅ Multiple template variations
- ⚠️ Less dynamic content

**GPT-Powered (Optional):**
- ✅ More dynamic, contextual content
- ✅ Better adaptation to article topics
- ✅ Natural language variation
- ⚠️ Requires API key and costs
- ⚠️ Potential for inconsistent voice

## Hashtag Generation

The system automatically generates relevant hashtags based on:
- Article title and summary keywords
- Trivance AI core hashtags (#AI, #TrivanceAI, #SmallBusiness)
- Industry-specific tags (#ChatGPT, #Automation, #Strategy, etc.)
- Maximum of 7 hashtags per post

## Post Generation Styles
